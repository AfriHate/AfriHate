We are pleased to announce that our research group, HausaNLP of Bayero University Kano, in collaboration with bertie company, ethiopia, LT and UP have successfully secured Lacuna Fund grant to develop resources for the development of resources for Hate and Offensive Speech detection in 18 African Languages.


Our project will introduce AfriHate, the first labelled dataset for online hate and abusive language detection in Africa, covering 18 languages.  We will also be creating baseline machine learning models for each language, which will be made available to other researchers, civil society organisations and social media platforms to use. This is a first-of-its-kind project which has the potential to transform how online hate is understood, tackled and researched across Africa. It is our hope that our work will lead to a safer cyber space for social interactions in Africa.



We would like to thank the team and collaborators who will be working on this project, including @Ibrahim, @Idris, @shamsud, @Bert,@Saed, @Debora, @Nedjma, @Devid @Sebastain. We would like to extend our thanks to the Lacuna Fund for their support of this project.
